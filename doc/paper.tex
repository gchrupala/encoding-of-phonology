\begin{abstract}
  We study the representation and encoding of phonemes in a recurrent
  neural network model of grounded speech. We use a model which
  processes images and their spoken descriptions, and projects the
  visual and auditory representations into the same semantic space. We
  perform a number of analyses on how information about individual
  phonemes is encoded in the MFCC features extracted from the speech
  signal, and the activations of the layers of the model. Via
  experiments with phoneme decoding and phoneme discrimination we show
  that phoneme representations are most salient in the lower layers of
  the model, where low-level signals are processed at a fine-grained
  level, although a large amount of phonological information is retain at
  the top recurrent layer. We further find out that the
  attention mechanism following the top recurrent layer significantly
  attenuates encoding of phonology and makes the utterance embeddings
  much more invariant to synonymy. Moreover, a hierarchical clustering
  of phoneme representations learned by the network shows an
  organizational structure of phonemes similar to those proposed in
  linguistics.
